This library is used to handle webhook calls from Rubygems.org and record gem dependency data into a database that backs PowerDNS so that the dependency data can be retrieved with DNS queries.

To run the Sinatra server locally:

  bundle exec rackup config.ru

To trigger the webhook:

  curl -d @docs/sample-post.json http://localhost:9292/webhook/accept
